  name: Hi, I'm Ash!
  role: I'm an AGN researcher.
  description: AGN Researcher | Women in Physics Coordinator | Science Communicator

about: |
  **Ashley Monaghan is a Masters student** in astrophysics at the University of Melbourne, specialising in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), X-ray astronomy, and machine learning applications to large-scale sky surveys. Her research combines optical and X-ray data to explore the physical conditions and structure of quasars. A key focus is on emission line diagnostics, black hole mass estimation, and identifying unusual AGN through statistical and machine learning techniques.


  Prior to her Masters, Ash completed a Bachelor of Science in Physics (First Class Honours) at the University of Melbourne. During her undergraduate studies, Ash contributed to projects including Belle II, SABRE, and TMOS. At Belle II, she studied axion-like particles and dark photons to support mesogenesis and baryogenesis theories, aiding searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. With SABRE South, she performed sensitivity studies on low-mass WIMPs, exploring the Migdal effect to enhance detection. In TMOS, she worked on plasmonic metasurfaces and advanced imaging, gaining experience in instrumentation and simulation.


  Outside research, she serves as Women in Physics Coordinator, advocating for diversity and inclusion in STEM and creating opportunities for underrepresented groups. She is passionate about science communication and has delivered talks and workshops for public audiences and university groups.


  Her broader interests include black hole feedback, AGN evolution, spectral modelling, dark matter/energy and the role of AGN in galaxy formation.
